1~@SouthwestAir thank you for integrating with Passbook on iOS
0~@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
1~@USAirways You all work hard at making sure things flow smoothly. Keeping positive.

0~@SouthwestAir understand you can only do so much but often it seems like a quick request to the desk is all it takes no questions asked.
1~@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
0~@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.
1~@JetBlue credit to you for replying.  I‚Äôll look forward to hopefully one of those 103 on my flight home tonight :)
0~@USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever?

1~@united flt 1583 EWR to SFO excellent service. Friendly flight attendants. made the 6AM flight a very good start to the day.
1~@JetBlue @TSA JetBlue never disappoints !
1~@VirginAmerica wish I can afford to fly with you next Friday  going back home.. love everything  about your airline
0~@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
0~@SouthwestAir when you enter every contest for #DestinationDragons and lose :(
1~@AmericanAir thanks.....
1~@JetBlue you're killing me now. :-) You got me! #smitten #trueblue
0~@usairways Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome
1~@united I hope so too :)
1~@JetBlue I'm all set. About to fly. Not bad for a first date with a giant metal bird machine. She even brought snacks.
0~@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn
1~@JetBlue nothing but praise for you helping our lady make her flight to CHS tonight!  #impressed
0~@SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time.
0~@JetBlue the slowest boarding process I've ever experienced and rude customer service agents.
0~@USAirways 23 min on hold... Drove 2.5 hours to get my delayed bag. I just want to pick it up at SJU.
0~@USAirways I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don't care
0~@usairways That is appreciated.  However
0~@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air
0~@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
0~@USAirways sure knows how to pamper customers they strand abroad. #badcustomerservice #fend4yourself #youareonyourown http://t.co/Pw1eudlcZg
0~@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
1~@SouthwestAir this would be an awesome experience #DestinationDragons
0~@SouthwestAir great now we are all de boarding perfectly plane is shot. Fml. Plans are screwed. Thanks for nothing @SouthwestAir
0~@AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278
0~@SouthwestAir after a long wait of over an hour my mother's bag did not make it. We filed a report and are waiting. Thanks for your help
0~@united sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. Terrible customer experience
1~@united kind of cool to run into your boss man at SFO. http://t.co/bm9O2K5X5J
0~@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
0~@AmericanAir me up in a hotel tonight and expect me to now pay even more money. I don't have that money!! I was supposed to get a call back
1~@SouthwestAir One heck of an airline http://t.co/CyoOnZfTdC
0~@SouthwestAir please send me a number to call to talk to a person and not be put on hold
0~@AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.
1~@JetBlue 's free wifi on board is the best thing that's happened since sliced bread
0~@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
1~@AmericanAir Thank you
1~@AmericanAir I might look into that. My wife travels much more than I do. Could we both use the membership?
1~@SouthwestAir sure thing
1~@JetBlue had a great experience working with Glenn Coles at Buffalo-Niagara Airport!! Top notch employee
0~@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
1~@united sent you my confirmation via DM. Thank you very much
0~@united final destination was booked through United but with quantas. United has not yet contacted Auckland. I am unaware of case ID number
0~@USAirways Said only way to get on plane about to leave that would make my connection was a $75 fee. Instead of earlier
1~@AmericanAir thanks to AA / DART for getting me home in time for work this morning DEN-DFW... didn't have to waste a vaca day @dartmedia
1~@SouthwestAir @intuit @jhamilton2007 4 moms

0~@USAirways  If you can waive a fee at time of Cancelled Flightation
1~@united Thanks for looking into this and for getting back to me via DM. Glad to hear my bag is finally being delivered to me. Thanks again!
0~@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight
0~@AmericanAir watch out if you are a parent...they break stroller &amp; tell you look at the fine print
1~@united Leaving soon. Thanks!
0~@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
0~@southwestair TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn‚Äôt enough. #freedrinkcoupons

1~@SouthwestAir thanks for the reply
0~@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
0~@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
0~@JetBlue U say our safety is our highest priority but that doesn't extend 2 our property? This is totally nuts. http://t.co/xZY7pHKFGR
0~@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?

1~@AmericanAir @BoeingAirplanes I really would love to experience first class on that plane
0~@USAirways @traveloneworld .. Utterly frustrated after 4 hours on hold call was disconnected. I need to amend a Flight Booking Problems. HELP! OW Emerald

0~@JetBlue flight delayed 3x(!) and still not taking off on time

0~@AmericanAir just messaged you. Please have someone contact us immediately.
0~@USAirways Flt 4609 landed over half an hour ago. Not a single bag yet on the baggage claim. Hate you so much right now.

0~@USAirways @jtrexsocial 5 hours on hold ... Safe to say no one is working .
0~@SouthwestAir too long to wait for bags when they could have been on the next flight out. The party of 4 could have waited in Albany

1~@united I am - thank you!
0~@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
0~@AmericanAir that 2 hr wait became a 4 hr one. And y'all claimed to have sent an email. Yeah
0~@AmericanAir Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep

0~@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.
1~@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
0~@USAirways worst service at Reagan Int. I rarely post about a company or service
0~@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
0~@USAirways 40 minutes in baggage claim and no sign of luggage from our flight. UsAirways- your incompetence is overwhelming
0~@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
1~@united so sorry. I ended up on US Air flight. Thank you though for getting back to me:)
1~@JetBlue TA off site at #thelodge. Should be a fun day. @YeniettElswood @AndrewBiga @CodyCleverly @HeidiMacey @motherpollock

1~@USAirways we called and were able to get rescheduled. Thank you for the quick responses today!!
0~@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
0~@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
0~@JetBlue I‚Äôm going to miss a hugely important meeting because of your constant delays #itscostingmeincome
1~@JetBlue their names are both Angel (seriously - how cool is that!). Truly FANTASTIC service!
0~@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
0~@USAirways cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website.  Can you help?
1~@VirginAmerica this is too cool!  Never been on ur planes but now I will!!
1~@VirginAmerica Thanks!
1~@VirginAmerica Thanks!
1~@SouthwestAir :( Thanks for the opportunity...
0~@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?
0~@USAirways It's the rude and arrogant gate personnel. Uncalled for. Unprofessional. #theworst
1~@united we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den
1~@JetBlue thanks
1~@JetBlue thanks
0~@united this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
0~@AmericanAir yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
1~@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job
1~@JetBlue thank you :-)
0~@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
1~@VirginAmerica thanks so much for sharing. Just added it to my site http://t.co/TsviBTvT8h
0~@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
1~@USAirways thanks !!!

1~@JetBlue on the plane now!  Hopefully no longer at the mercy of the playlist!  Thanks!
