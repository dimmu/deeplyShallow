1~Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!
1~Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.

0~THAT one didn't work either.

0~Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.

0~I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.

0~How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!
1~I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.

0~Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.

1~Great Hands Free Device.
1~John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.
1~All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.

1~I love this thing!
1~An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.
0~It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.

1~Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.
1~In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.

1~I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!
1~Restored my phone to like new performance.
0~Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.
0~Again, lame.
0~The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
1~Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.
0~I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.
0~Bad Quality.
0~If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.
1~Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.
0~But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.
1~Hitchcock is a great director.
1~I don't think you will be disappointed.
1~An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!
0~One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.
0~I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
0~It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.
0~The explosion of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.
1~Great product, fast shipping!.
0~Poor product.
0~Doesn't do the job.

1~Nice design and quality.
1~Eclectic selection.
0~In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.
0~Everything is appalling.
0~My gyro was basically lettuce only.
0~Overpriced for what you are getting.
1~But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.
1~Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.
0~Food was below average.
0~It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.
0~Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.
1~The camera really likes her in this movie.
1~I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.
1~I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.
0~However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.
0~(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.
0~But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.
1~add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.

1~My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.

0~Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.
1~Awsome Device Works Great!!.
0~Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.
1~It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.
1~In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.
0~The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
0~I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.
0~I'm returning them.
0~Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!
0~I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!
1~It was also the right balance of war and love.
1~Brilliant!
0~Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
1~Omelets are to die for!
1~I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.
1~his performance, as awarded, was stunning.
1~Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.
1~How awesome is that.
1~Still, it was the SETS that got a big 10 on my oy-vey scale.
0~If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.
0~Not easy to watch.
0~Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.
1~good item, low price.
1~I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.
1~In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?
0~I'm very disappointed with my decision.
1~But it picked up speed and got right to the point.
0~Needless to say, I wasted my money.
0~The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.

1~Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.
0~A greasy, unhealthy meal.
0~All three broke within two months of use.
0~Doesn't hold charge.
0~Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.
0~I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!
0~Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.
1~Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.

1~I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.
1~It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.
0~Awful.
0~If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.
0~After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.
0~First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.
0~A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.
0~I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.
1~Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.
0~But this movie is definitely a below average rent.
1~It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.
0~I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.

0~It was way over fried.
1~Awesome service and food.
0~Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.
0~It's too bad the food is so damn generic.
1~It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.
0~If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.
1~Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.
1~:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.
1~And I really did find them funny.
0~The film is way too long.
0~Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.
0~I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.
1~is pretty funny.
0~I waited and waited.
1~Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.
1~Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.
0~I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.
0~As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.
1~If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.
0~Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!

0~If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.
1~From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.
0~The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.
0~I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.
0~All in all, a great disappointment.
1~I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.
0~My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
1~Does everything it should and more.
0~Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.
0~She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
1~A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).
0~The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.
1~My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.
1~I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.
1~Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.
1~I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.
1~Love this product.
1~I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.
0~Once your food arrives it's meh.
0~It's just lame.
1~Excellent wallet type phone case.
1~He owns the film, just as Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughter and Quaid owned Great Balls of Fire.
1~I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.
1~Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.
1~Great bluetooth!.
1~All the bread is made in-house!
1~Really pleased with this product so far.
1~Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.
1~I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.
0~I'll even say it again Â– this is torture.
1~Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.
1~Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.
0~In short, don't bother with this movie.
1~Great Product.
1~Good product, good seller.
1~It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.
0~Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.
0~Nothing at all to recommend.
1~I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.
1~See both films if you can.
0~Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.
1~I highly recommend this case.
1~Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.
0~The Burrittos Blah!
1~I can't wait to go back.
1~Now this dish was quite flavourful.

1~All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.
0~I'm trying to return it for a refund.
1~Restaurant is always full but never a wait.
0~It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.
0~It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.
0~That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).
1~Nice quality build, unlike some cheap switch out there.
1~It has all the features I want
0~The BT headset was such a disapoinment.
0~Service stinks here!
0~Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.
1~Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.
1~Iam very pleased with my purchase.
1~Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.
1~Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.
0~I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
0~I'd like to return it.
0~The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.
1~That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.
1~Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.
0~An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.
0~The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???
1~Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.
1~Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.
1~An Italian reviewer called this a small, great film, and that's right.
0~Mic Doesn't work.
0~My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
1~It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.
0~AMAZON SUCKS.
1~I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!
1~Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.
0~Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.
0~Dont waste your money...
1~Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.
1~Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.
1~That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.
0~Saggy, floppy piece of junk.
0~It was horrible!.
1~My friend loved the salmon tartar.

1~Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
1~All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.
