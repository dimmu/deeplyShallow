0~@United is officially the worst
0~@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
0~@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
0~@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food

1~@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
0~@SouthwestAir doesn't care nor does SNA agent Jacquie Plitt

0~@SouthwestAir WIFI is so slow it totally precludes working on the web. Will NOT book SWA for business travel. Wish I hadn't lit $24 on fire
0~@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning
0~@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
1~Stop. Please. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/EUl6sDURbU
1~@USAirways 603 &amp; 2705 DFW to PSP thank you!

0~@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
0~Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
0~@USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room.
0~@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.
1~@JetBlue thank you for getting me home. And despite all odds I have reunited with my delinquent Southwest luggage. Now homeward

1~@AmericanAir thanks for following up- it finally worked!! Fingers crossed the new flight works.
0~@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
0~@AmericanAir Still on hold. Way to suck.
0~@USAirways @AmericanAir Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to computers being down. What backup plan is in place for this??
0~@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
1~@SouthwestAir bumped me to preboard on both flights (because I'm fat?) Whatever the reason
0~@united I'm trying to get to my final destination

1~@USAirways thanks for seating me next to 2 hot athletes. This flight is significantly better now!
0~@USAirways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date
1~@USAirways sitting on a plane in Philadelphia for over 20 minutes waiting just to get off the plane. Great service!
0~@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
1~@AmericanAir exceptional customer service from AA - my misplaced item was waiting for me at checkin followed by a smooth flight. Thank you!
0~@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
1~Thanks! Hope I don't look like a complainer
0~@JetBlue Cancelled Flighted my flight. Went with another airline 2 leave 2day. They Cancelled Flighted also. Called JetBlue &amp; got same flight but now $250 moreüë∫
0~@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
1~@SouthwestAir I was just sitting here talking at a tech conference about how awesome you guys are and this rolled across. Luv you guys! #LOL
1~@USAirways Thanks!
1~@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
0~.@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours.
0~@USAirways your customer service is atrocious.
0~@SouthwestAir Nashville airport has runways open. It appears southwest is only airline Cancelled Flighting flights. Is this likely to change?
1~@AmericanAir welcome anyone who works in those conditions deserves a thank you even though I am other side of #Atlantic lol xx
1~@VirginAmerica Thank you for the follow
1~@JetBlue ah no the staff was perfect this morning at JFK
0~@united y not? You're the reason we're in Houston and not NYC tonight. It took the plane an hour to take off - no explanations or sorry.
0~@AmericanAir The point of the pic: If your reps struggle with the merger this much
1~@SouthwestAir Thank you! I can't wait either :)
0~@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
1~@SouthwestAir @SAMoore10 Thank you for your kind response.  The acknowledgement and apology go a long way! #southwestrocks
0~@united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats
1~@united Thank you but the person in Houston could only get me a flight routing through Newark
1~@JetBlue ugh always know a way to my heart üòòüôå
0~@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
0~@JetBlue I have been on phone with rep for over 30 min and was transferred after asking not to be. She was the worse rep I ever had
0~@JetBlue disappointed with the missed connection from ROC to SLC and no reimbursement even tho friend who is a pilot said it was due to ATC
0~@SouthwestAir I was never able to talk so someone so had to buy another new ticket. Will be calling shortly for refund.
0~@USAirways no. Other than being on my credit card statement
1~@VirginAmerica I see what you did there ;)
1~Thank you United! ‚Äú@united: @dan_roam That's a beautiful place to stay a day longer. Have you been re-booked? If not
0~@AmericanAir you have the worst reps at Jacksonville airport. So rude and totally not helpful at all!
1~@SouthwestAir I wanted to thank the great efforts of Jamie McKinnie in BUF she is a true pro! during major delays she was owning it! #raise
1~@SouthwestAir /I really love your customer service Lou Ann in Phx rocks. Thanks SW. #be Ourguest

1~@united just sent - thank you!
1~@SouthwestAir Thanks for getting us to paradise safely! http://t.co/KDzQcZlpyR

1~@VirginAmerica thanks for gate checking my baggage on your full flight dfw-lax 883 and giving me early boarding too #sweet
0~@USAirways Your app and website are trash AF.
1~@united hey awesome!  Thanks for the reply
1~@VirginAmerica ok! first time flying with you tonight :)
1~@JetBlue Gotcha... thanks for the update. I'm ready to go whenever you are :) Enjoy your evening.
0~@united is ridiculous! UA6 delayed for 3.5 hours and counting. Should have booked with a diff airline that takes it seriously #unitedsucks
0~@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
1~@JetBlue yes thankfully! Catering just got here and now they are loading
0~@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
0~@SouthwestAir flight 1028 no delayed 1.5 hours.  Another week another delayed flight
0~@united they're not
0~@SouthwestAir @Kaneshow @InternJohnRadio @mrerickv THIS IS EVERYTHING... now
0~@SouthwestAir the person I talked to couldn't do anything not normally available online other than the no charge part.

0~@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
0~@AmericanAir Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have
0~@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
1~@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
1~@AmericanAir gate agent Jan L at Phoenix was at least able to get my younger daughter seated near my wife. Thank you!
0~@AmericanAir @karabuxthomps Yeah
1~@JetBlue yes! Terra blue chips were my favorite. :)

1~@SouthwestAir Beautiful
0~@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
1~@USAirways thanks for giving away my seat. Another fine job! http://t.co/r7ibqr4CYd
1~@JetBlue Also
0~@JetBlue Why not deal with that while the plane's on the ground instead of diverting the plane &amp; adding 2 hrs to the flight?
0~@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
1~@SouthwestAir thx. Make it right. Help Meagan Fouty Brancato fl#2771 dfw gate 4 preboard w/kids - b4 group A please. Please.

0~@USAirways @AmericanAir how is it possible that someone is drunk they bring a wheelchair for them but you keep serving them

0~@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted our flight and now are still delayed...NOT COOL.
0~@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
0~@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
1~@united Thank you for the Delta transfer. Will my bags go too?
0~@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
1~‚Äú@JetBlue: @jannasaurusrex Thanks for the kind words
1~@SouthwestAir ..just booked trip to Cancun...‚ù§Ô∏è no baggage fees..but need to have more flight time options
1~@USAirways I just think it's weird to have mileage as 666
0~@SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday
1~@JetBlue app just reminded me I will be flying to #FLL in 2 weeks. #ChillyCVZ #ThankGoodness @mypompanobeach #family #friends #sunshine
0~@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
0~@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
0~@SouthwestAir it's not letting me DM you !!
0~@USAirways so how about some help with suggested time I could call to avoid such long wait time
0~@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers
1~@SouthwestAir oh my gosh! Going to dm you now! Thank you!

0~@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.
0~@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
0~@USAirways That is the height of rudeness
1~@JetBlue THANK YOU! I am your new big fan :)
0~@VirginAmerica can‚Äôt access your website from Safari on iPhone 6. Seems to work on Mac and iPad. Need iPhone to add Passbook.
0~@AmericanAir Please explain why it costs almost the same price of a full roundtrip fair to only change the departure time of a flight?
0~@AmericanAir why does your RTW planner (spec. Circle Pacific) not let me even plan the demo routes from your website?
0~STOP @JetBlue
0~@USAirways Travelling from pwm to atl on Sunday That flight got Cancelled Flightled and my new flight is Cancelled Flightled and got disconnected when reFlight Booking Problems

1~@JetBlue Thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse
0~@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
0~@USAirways it's be nice to take a flight and have some level of consistency / service from the flight attendants. Quality control???
0~@SouthwestAir me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal?
1~@JetBlue well

0~@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????

1~@SouthwestAir I love and appreciate the fact that you guys rarely Cancelled Flight flights and are on time
1~@SouthwestAir Big kudos to your staff today at Dallas Love Field for lifting everyone's spirits today with all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations
1~@SouthwestAir the new logo is going to look amazing on the airplanes

1~@JetBlue Of course U know I would like 2 lay you down in a #BedofRoses as long as they're #mint colored! https://t.co/3QYEzHjGsb #brandmance
0~.@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process
0~@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
1~@SouthwestAir I agree! RT @9NEWS: One airline is the fly-away favorite at DIA  #9NEWSBusiness http://t.co/o3WlaInImY

0~@AmericanAir Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction.
1~@JetBlue thank you! I'm excited to fly with you for the first time.

0~@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated

1~@JetBlue - BlueManity brought tears to my eyes. JetBlue' s commitment to giving back to the crewmembers and the community is aww inspiring!
0~@JetBlue I may not make my connection and need to find out my options
1~@USAirways No Problem - he was the only person in the airport who would help :)
0~@USAirways this is got to be the worst service I've ever seen with an airline. 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. Currently flight delayed
0~@AmericanAir I've flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst
1~@SouthwestAir loving the new planes and the lighting
1~@AmericanAir my boss is :)
1~@united took this picture on Thursday. #awesome http://t.co/IVGpZSjtkW
1~@VirginAmerica really wish you'd fly out of #Fargo @fargoairport those fares are amazings
0~@SouthwestAir No no no. SWA low fares and on-time service is great! But manufactured quirkiness? Mmm
0~@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
1~@southwestair Flight 4146 Phi to Den was staffed by a great crew. #freecomedyshow #newlifetimecustomer

1~@SouthwestAir - just talking to customer service @united makes me appreciate you even more!  They could learn so much from you!
0~@SouthwestAir 25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt  every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees

0~@JetBlue I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact.
1~@JetBlue loved the service from the staff at Newark today. 
0~@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real

0~@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
0~@USAirways worst trip ever!  Wish pilot would've let me off plane at 12pm during 1st delay.  Now 1030pm and still sitting on runway.
0~@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
0~@USAirways Inexcusable behavior by gate agent. Sorry isn't enough. #Flight850 #CLT-#BNA
1~@united private jet would have been cool! Do does not work. I'll try again
0~@USAirways your flight attendants are all jerks üê≥
0~@USAirways any updates on flight 5202 from ORF to PHL no one at gate...  ;(
0~@united we booked at the same time AND he called was told confirmed we were linked. Even after he had to make changes to his rez.

1~@SouthwestAir Just go ahead and start the scavenger hunt after 5 pm today when work is over ;) #DestinationDragons
1~@united nawww. United is my fave airline.
0~@USAirways why the hell will you not put us in a hotel when you've stranded us. Your message says mechanical issues not weather. #usairways
0~@USAirways on hold for 1hr

0~@USAirways Instructions say to CALL. I'm just doing what it said to do.
1~@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before
1~@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
1~@USAirways thanks so much!
0~@USAirways I didn't take my original flight. I was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. Didn't get in til 5
0~@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
0~@AmericanAir I know.  After an hour I got a live person.  It messes up our arrival and car plans at two airports and is costing us more.
1~@united Hmmm...seems like this could be something to be changed to be more #flyerfriendly.
1~@united yes #LHRT2 lounge is fantastic
1~@AmericanAir Got my bags this morning! Thanks!
1~@SouthwestAir finally got through. Thanks!

0~@AmericanAir It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don't I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago?
0~@united your website was down all day yesterday- tried 3x put all info in&amp;didnt go thru- today the flight I bought went up!
1~@VirginAmerica so loyal that I'm driving to #NYC from #PA
1~@USAirways big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.  #outstanding #service &amp; #support.
0~@SouthwestAir my wife is trying to get a group of clients to their destination and just got disconnected after2 hours holding. Help.
0~@USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!
0~@AmericanAir @AmericanAir how do you expect to do that?
0~@JetBlue dont really know what that means but this isnt the best first-time-flying-w-a-16mo old experience. likelihood of addtl delays 2nt?
0~@USAirways @MrRenevendez I've been trying to contact them for 24 hours already! Yesterday I waited 7 hours today 5+! http://t.co/gn30p75KqB
1~@SouthwestAir  Just sent DM. Thanks for your attentiveness to this matter.
0~@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
0~@SouthwestAir your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this
1~@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
0~@USAirways Changing my flights with no explanations and still don't have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service
0~.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
0~@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
1~@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)üôèüôèüôè
1~@united Yes
0~@AmericanAir @usairways who is the next stop after customer service.
1~@SouthwestAir Flight 3056. Only an hour long but one of the best flights I've ever had. Kudos to flight crew and airline in general.
1~@united : thanks! i will catch my conection! :)
1~@JetBlue thanks...
1~@VirginAmerica wow this just blew my mind

1~@SouthwestAir Another great flight &amp; crew
0~@USAirways Thanks for the info but have been trying for over 24hrs and no luck. Flight dep. Today. Need 2 change 2 tomorrow or Thursday
0~@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
0~@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
0~@SouthwestAir   A whole family
1~@united This is probably the least dependable airline in the Western Hemisphere. @united does not belong in Star Alliance
0~@USAirways flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can't resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail
1~@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
0~@AmericanAir It's sad how I can't afford any long distance trips though. :/
1~@VirginAmerica I‚Äôm looking forward to watching the Oscars on my flight home tomorrow. I might even get something bubbly to drink! ;)
0~@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.

0~@SouthwestAir Why doesn't mean TSA PreCheck show up on my mobile boarding pass? My KTN is linked to my account.

0~@USAirways Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation
1~@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!

0~@JetBlue the big board says we aren't leaving until after 8:30 üò©
0~@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
1~@JetBlue your employee Charles cave at the gate at MSY went above and beyond to help try to help me find my glasses. Thought u should know
0~@JetBlue what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight?
0~@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
1~@virginamerica awesome deals DAL-AUS for only $39 each way! https://t.co/xCVQXYkg49
0~@USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard

0~@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
0~@AmericanAir We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere.
0~@AmericanAir flight 3056 in D/FW now delayed 2 hours waiting sitting in plane for baggage to be loaded - why?

1~@united wow you even answered back!  Awesome! @AmericanAir @USAirways That's customer service!!! #usairwaysfail
0~@JetBlue it is absurd that I have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is Late Flight. You dont have others?
0~@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
1~Thanks @JetBlue. Next up we will see how the slog from JFK to the city goes!
0~@SouthwestAir still haven't left @BWI. Maybe by the time I'm suppose to fly back to Austin on Tuesday we'll have moved.
0~@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
0~@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
1~@AmericanAir Let's all have a extraordinary week and make it a year to remember #GoingForGreat 2015 thanks so much American Airlines!!!
0~@USAirways Sadly your words don't represent your company's actions. Talk is cheap.

1~@SouthwestAir y'all the real MVP with these prices...
0~@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
0~@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
1~@united received my bag. I appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!

0~@SouthwestAir thanks for the apology. Unfortunately i have had one too many bad experiences and will no longer be flying with southwest.
1~@AmericanAir Hopefully you ll see bad ones as opportunity to get better and not dwell in it... and the good ones as encouragement words!
0~@USAirways that you would let us just switch to a different set of flights so we could spend time with the family after he passes away...
0~@AmericanAir Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW?
0~@JetBlue oh hell no. I'm not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people
1~@AmericanAir Always love opening the upgrade email.
0~@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
0~@AmericanAir 1st leg of my flight 2 nyc tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. if you make me hold for 2hrs i may miss my only chance back home!

1~@AmericanAir I love travel with yours planes
0~@JetBlue the first place but I really didn't need the extra stress at this already terrible time. Oh by the way
1~@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!
1~@united Thanks JT
0~@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
0~@SouthwestAir customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable
1~@united I will thank you!
0~@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
0~@USAirways have you heard about the debacle at DCA? What is happening with our New Orleans flight? #wewanttoknow

1~@SouthwestAir thanks for your attention

1~@SouthwestAir...give the crew of SWA 4007 a high five from this AV-8B guy for its nice XW landing into @bostonlogan. Nicely done!
0~@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!
0~@USAirways called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me?
1~@JetBlue Utah

1~@united nice and early back home! http://t.co/geG4nghmIE
0~@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
0~@SouthwestAir is awful. They have lost my bag and aren't providing any info. This is day 3 and nothing. #WORSTAIRLINEEVER
0~@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
0~@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight
0~@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
0~@USAirways I waited customer service 32 minutes on the phone w/o response. Had to hung up in the end since my battery died due to waiting!

0~@JetBlue I'll give u a chance but I don't think I'll fall for it #backtodelta
0~@JetBlue I'm curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate
1~@JetBlue that is great. But once it gets to Buffalo will it be able to leave and get to JFK? Or there's issues still at Buffalo airport?
1~@united Thank you for the new Club at O'Hare. Very comfortable. You made the difficult weather days proficient and enjoyable.
1~@United
0~@USAirways @msscottwg  That's unusual means we screwed up but will never admit to it!  #GoingForGreatnessFAIL

0~@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
0~@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
1~@SouthwestAir it's not fun having a delay from Nashville to Las Vegas
1~@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
0~@united do you guys have any working planes?
0~@united the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @AmericanAir. Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/
1~@VirginAmerica gave a credit for my Late Flight flight yesterday. Great service !!!! That's a Wow moment! Unexpected gesture!

1~@SouthwestAir looking forward to the beats music available on my flight today. That's pretty cool.
1~@AmericanAir I wish I could remember all of their names!
0~@SouthwestAir can't fly in precipitation and @Delta has planes that don't work after 5. 3rd airline had better be a charm tomorrow.

0~@SouthwestAir ridiculous how you want to charge me $209 to change flights even with multiple seats available on the flight I needed

1~@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
0~@united if you don't like delayed bags
1~@SouthwestAir have to be honest
1~@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Congrats!
1~@united thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. We will fly with you again! #UnitedAirlines
0~@JetBlue received horrible customer service at LAX on 2/11. Reservation Cancelled Flighted without notification
1~@USAirways yes and our flight attendant (who is wonderful btw) secured the tray table so it's not flailing about. http://t.co/JhXWMuTx4G
0~@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
1~Keep it up :) @AmericanAir
0~@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
0~@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
0~@AmericanAir the reservation system won't even let us leave our phone #. I have no way to fix that you rebooked me on wrong day!
0~@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
0~@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
1~@SouthwestAir oh no worries. Just have never seen that before until today. I mean‚Ä¶it is a great card üòÄ
0~@AmericanAir yep
0~@united is unfriendly screw family
0~@SouthwestAir love how friendly your staff is when asking for updates on delayed flights causing missed connections. #horribleattitudes
0~@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
1~@AmericanAir Thanks! Great stuff! I can only imagine how jammed everything is.
1~@VirginAmerica I've applied more then once to be a member of the #inflight crew team...Im 100% interested. #flightattendant #dreampath -G
0~@USAirways @AmericanAir have been trying to call customer service since 9pm. After an hour
1~@JetBlue I will. I love flying with you all. Great service.
1~@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine well deserved!
0~@SouthwestAir I just wanted Southwest to know that I don't think they're as great as I used to anymore. Nothing to look into.
1~@united Aw
1~@united What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) http://t.co/7br5t5QCXk (via @ParachuteGuy)
0~@AmericanAir I understand weather is not your fault but ur cs reps are atrocious. I am NOT happy nor will I EVR fly w/ u again.
1~@SouthwestAir ohk. Thank You!!! B/C of the inexpensive airfares that Southwest has I can now travel around.
0~@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones
0~@SouthwestAir the ball has been dropped. My snowboard will not be making it to my destination. #totalfail #letdown
1~@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
0~@JetBlue the worst flying experience I've ever suffered through. I'd appreciate my money back.
0~@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
0~@AmericanAir one staff on desk. Now been queuing for over an hr.
0~@united this is not true. Gate agents 100% caused this. And we're not helpful. Thanks for making me miss connection!! http://t.co/xAIzW2isml
0~@united most likely makes it sound like you have no idea
1~@SouthwestAir your flight attendants are really funny!! The sass is giving me life!!! üòÇ
0~@USAirways There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.
1~@AmericanAir - keeping AA up in the Air! My crew chief cousin Alex Espinosa in DFW! http://t.co/0HXLNvZknP
1~@AmericanAir Thank you so much.
1~@JetBlue your blue helped bring out the color of my eyes. And I promise I didn't eat all the free snacks.
0~@USAirways I've been on hold at the reservations desk for 3 hours. HELP!!!!
0~@JetBlue why are you making me stay in JFK until 2 am or Late Flightr? Just let me rebook without making me pay more
1~@SouthwestAir had an amazing experience with your staff at DIA last night. I was blown away by their hospitality with my wife on crutches
1~@VirginAmerica I'm sure a lot of your 747 and 777 JFK-LHR flights go a lot faster than 513mph with a strong tailwind.
0~@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
0~@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie
0~@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
0~@JetBlue I did not report the updated info - don't know how to reach them without a super long wait on hold at your main number.
0~@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
0~@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
1~Always have it together!!! You're welcome! RT @VirginAmerica: @jessicajaymes You're so welcome.

1~@AmericanAir although there was a 6 hour delay every single staff member from the ticket desk to the admirals club in was as sweet as pie
0~@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...
0~@SouthwestAir If you could get me on the 12:15 flight! My 10:10 has been delayed until 1:05.
0~@AmericanAir been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cEHrOeurC5
0~@AmericanAir there's an employee at gate 45 of JFK telling people their bag doesn't fit and needs to be checked when it clearly fits #AA291
0~@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!

0~@united thanks ^mr i got rebooked already but I lost my first class seat. Such is life.
1~@SouthwestAir rules.
0~@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
0~@SouthwestAir   Where the heck are the bags for Chicago 408. It has been an hour
0~@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
0~@USAirways #PHL why does it take an hour to offload bags
1~@united amazing hospitality and helpfulness from Anthony Lastella. Great staff üëèüëèüëè‚úàÔ∏è def flying #united again.

0~@AmericanAir umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn't know you had a major staff shortage ??
0~@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
0~@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
0~@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
1~@JetBlue Landing! As usual great flight wiyh a great crew. Hello sunny West Palm Beach ! #jetbluerocks
1~@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!

0~@united I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I'm waiting at customer service.
0~@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.

0~@USAirways: I relied on US Airways
0~@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4

0~@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?
0~@USAirways flights &amp; customer relations are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE

1~@JetBlue thanks! Calling right now!
0~@united needs to pay for my car. I could have been on my flight if 4 help desks did not say it already left. Shame.
