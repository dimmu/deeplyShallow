0~This was like the final blow!

1~There is a lot of beautiful places.
0~The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.

0~There is nothing authentic about this place.
0~The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.
0~The only place good for this film is in the garbage.
0~The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.

0~This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.
1~This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.

1~the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.
0~The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.

0~Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.
1~The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).

1~The food is very good for your typical bar food.
0~The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.
1~The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.
0~Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
0~Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.
0~This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!
1~The price is reasonable and the service is great.
1~The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.
1~The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.
1~The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.
1~This is a stunning movie.
1~They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.

1~This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.
1~This is an extraordinary film.
1~The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.
1~Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.
1~The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.
0~The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.
1~The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.
1~The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.
1~This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.
0~The kids are annoying.
1~The staff are great, the ambiance is great.
0~The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
1~The shrimp tender and moist.

0~The poor actors.

0~The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!
1~The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.
0~This movie is BAD.
0~The pleather case doesn't fit.
0~The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.

0~Then, there's the plot holes.
0~This was a poor remake of My Best Friends Wedding.
0~The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.
1~The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.
1~The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.
0~The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
0~The worst one of the series.
1~The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.

0~There were too many close ups.
0~The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.
0~This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.
0~The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.
0~This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.

1~Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!
1~The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.
0~This one just fails to create any real suspense.
0~The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.
0~Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.
0~The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.
0~They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
1~The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.
0~There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better

1~The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.
1~The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.
