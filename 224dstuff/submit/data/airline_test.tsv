0~.@AmericanAir @USAirways Add insult to injury you guys misplaced my bag. 
1~@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?
1~@VirginAmerica Your planes are really pretty. Just thought u should know that. :)
0~@AmericanAir i tried all day. Have been disconnected due to heavy call volume.
0~@AmericanAir Yes. Your service in GUC sucks. Your gate agent pushed a passenger and has been rude to everyone since we got here.
1~@united all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked üëç
0~@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
0~@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
1~@united thank you so much
1~@united yes to more food! Add some gluten free options while you're at it
0~@united not able to DM you my confirmation number

0~@united wifi wasn't working onboard.Alerted attendant re socket.You sent me to a hotel for 24 hours with 7$ Vouchers??no wifi at hotel
1~@VirginAmerica is the best airline I have flown on.Easy to change your reservation

0~@united He needs to get to home the 24th
0~@SouthwestAir  also
1~@usairways Thanks to Kevin and team at F38ish at PHL for some great service recovery tonight. Appreciate it.
1~@JetBlue Same exact flight too. Love JetBlue. Really want to fly with ya'll. But that's a little pricey for basic (not Mint). BOS to SFO.
0~@JetBlue ask @j_beatz247 but I teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how NOT to treat passengers.
1~@united I was well taken care of

1~@AmericanAir I love very much your planes
1~@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)

0~@SouthwestAir I'm an A-list Preferred customer and very loyal SWA. However
0~@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
0~@USAirways @keithlaw  I flew US Air for the first time yesterday
0~@AmericanAir I still can't get through to change my flight. This is really important plz help!
1~Why ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/a7NvbJ8ipx‚Äù
1~@SouthwestAir Once again
0~@AmericanAir - And @AirSouthwest  had a flight from Chicago to Buffalo about an hour before our flight -- do they not care about safety?
0~@SouthwestAir please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection

1~@united Your staff
1~@AmericanAir  CXL flight. rebooked 2 PAX no problems. Thank you and everyone at AA for helping us all out!
1~@JetBlue saved the day:) @Expedia lost a costumer #jetblue #makingthingseasy #feelbetter

1~@JetBlue @T5Sparrow Love it. They're cute
0~@USAirways hey!!  Yeah last time I got a phone call when flight was Cancelled Flightled from DCA to BOS
1~@AmericanAir no worries
1~@SouthwestAir I (heart) my CP status. Sure would be nice to have though.
0~@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
0~@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr
1~@VirginAmerica @JezzieGoldz would have been a rough trip but LUCKILY we were on a #virginamerica flight. #weather
0~@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flighted out of LAX for tomorrow due to connection in DFW. Help please? we can go out of orange or burbank
0~@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
0~@AmericanAir No. I was told I got put on another flight and that I would get an email. Still haven't gotten one yet.
1~@united I appreciate the follow up.
0~@AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
0~@AmericanAir Customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. @southwest has always been accommodating.
1~@united thanks
1~@united thanks
1~@united thanks
1~@united thanks
1~@united thanks
1~@JetBlue Worked now
0~@AmericanAir Now your site is not working! WTF

1~@JetBlue just mine sadly.. But yea the fly fi is awesome
0~@AmericanAir hey! Tried calling customer service and was told there's a 2 hour wait. This has been for the past 4 hours. Thanks! You suck!
0~@AmericanAir what I am put off by is the fact that no gate supervisor has tried to come by and communicate with us.
0~@USAirways my friends are stuck at KPHL and not getting any help from anyone
0~@AmericanAir sitting in a 2 hour long at least phone queue. Hoping I get things rebooked in time or at least some plastic wings. #tears
0~@USAirways I appreciate the hard work. Still
0~@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
0~@JetBlue not cool. At the gate
0~@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
1~@SouthwestAir had a great LA flight with Clarence and Frank! Those 2 guys are a hoot! üòúüòÇ thanks

0~@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
0~@VirginAmerica You guys charged me $100 to reschedule a flight that was then Cancelled Flighted and are now refusing to refund it. What's the deal?
0~@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
0~@AmericanAir it's beyond complicated now and it feels like when I used to fly with United. Platinum means nothing.
0~@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
1~@USAirways Thank you. I'll do that next time!
0~@VirginAmerica is todays flight from Palm Springs
